  * Added: worker config command (#1849).
    Exposed an ability to watch Worker's config for its admin, master and
    inspection subjects.
  * Fixed: revert per-chunk stream authorization (#1848).
    It was implemented for inspection service, but no longer required, since it
    has a more convenient way to subscribe for authorization change events.
    Fixes inability to use "TaskLogs" handle.
  * Fixed: proper error type in ErrorOrNil (#1847).
    Fixed bug with task cancellation:
    - Process ask-plan which are pending for deletion in a usual pipeline to
    update order info in case ask-plan can not be deleted right now.
    - Return proper type from ErrorOrNil function to fix this

  * Added: remote QoS (#1841).
  * Added: worker inspection (#1835).
    Currently, if something goes wrong on a Worker we're still able to gain
    access to the remote computer via SSH to find of what's going on there.
    In the future, due to obvious trusted platform limitations, we will
    lose those capabilities, since there will be no direct access to the machine.
    This leads us to a situation where we still need to collect debugging
    information, but more likely in a post-mortem way.
    This feature introduces the inspection service on the Worker side, which
    is capable to collect various runtime and history information and
    provide it to the subject that is explicitly allowed by Worker's admin.
    New methods include config, list of open files, network information,
    various Docker info and of course - logs. Now it is possible both for
    Worker's admin and allowed users to subscribe to Worker logs.
    Also, Worker's API now allows to add and to remove additional
    capabilities like inspection service access or SSH'ing into the host.
  * Added: configurable pprof for DWH (#1840).
  * Added: oracle must process logs starting from the current block (#1625).
    This PR extends oracle with the following option: now it can process
    transactions from the current block, not from the beginning of the times. It
    was made because restarting non-master Oracle instance leads to full
    transaction log re-process, which is obviously useless.
  * Added: added rate counters in NPP dialer metrics (#1805).
  * Fixed: do not hang on deal cancellation (#1759).
  * Fixed: human-readable TC initialization error (#1838).
    Failing while initializing ifb device resulted in printing "Exit status 1",
    which is not obvious to understand what's going on. Now we will report at
    least which command we're trying to execute.
  * Fixed: exclude empty prerelease while building outside git (#1830).
  * Fixed: enable interceptor for REST interface on DWH (#1826).
  * Fixed: proper reaching "out of sync" state (#1824).
    This commit fixes random "out of sync" state reaching when there are no events
    has been produced in the chain.
    Now if the blockchain's "GetEvents" method returns no logs entities - we're
    emitting "NoEventsData" event which is processing as any other events. Event
    triggers an update of the lastBlock counter, and the "out of sync" state does
    not appear.

  * Added: TTL for servers in Rendezvous (#1773).
    Previously in a client tries to resolve remote server in the Rendezvous and
    that server is absent - the client is hanged for some period of time. This was
    reported as inconvenient because if such server has never been published it is
    meaningless even to try to wait for it.
    Moreover, when a server is resolved it cleans its announce mapping until the
    next announce, which causes flapping in the info handler.
    Now all servers are considered live and will not be removed from the info
    handle if they are capable to reannounce themselves in ~30s. Otherwise the
    immediate "no peer found" error will be returned to the client.
  * Fixed: memory leak in Optimus (#1785).
    Reduced default branch-bound model thresholds. Switch for default optimization
    method while calculating current worker's price.
  * Fixed: smart contracts migrations (#1778).
    This PR is intended to provide more clear and stable migration process:
    * migration artifacts now are saved in migration_artifacts folder to maintain
    migration data
    * migration contract from truffle suit is used.
    * all current migrations are packed into one, as we start from the beginning
    * useful makefile targets introduced
    * npm ci command is used for build stability.
  * Fixed: properly detect for "red" cards in monitoring handler (#1776).
    Now we have a situation when we have on-board and external video on the
    machine.
    Embedded graphics adapter also can be detected as DRI device, but does not
    provide any metrics interface.
    For GPU tuner plugin we're using a crutch: detecting device twice, via DRI and
    OpenCL, then comparing the results.
    This commit re-use that code to collect cards for monitoring interface.
  * Fixed: drop nvidia socket if exists (#1772).
    If a worker terminates unexpectedly, it leaves an orphaned socket file made by
    the NVidia GPU plugin.
    In such case the systemd cannot restart worker because of "address already in
    use" error. So we should remove this socket when initializing new listener for
    the GPU plugin.
  * Fixed: blockchain Events api from block processing (#1771).
    This PR fix behaviour which if fromBlock is not zero, events processing is
    unreachable, because "fromBlock" always greater to 1 than "toBlock".
  * Fixed: proper RAM metrics collection (#1769).
  * Fixed: close QUIC sessions and streams (#1770).

  * Fixed: random rendezvous hanging (#1758).
  * Fixed: proper close docker client (#1766).
    Without this fix Workers will probably become unreachable, because
    of file descriptors leaking.
  * Fixed: reduce noise while logging RPC calls (#1765).
    Currently we print stacktraces for any error that is logged. This is
    actually useful, but there are cases where it's more annoying than
    useful. For example - messages after RPC calls, where stacktraces are
    the same and completely useless.
    After this change we should no longer print those stacktraces in audit
    logs.
  * Fixed: do not stop gRPC servers on temporary QUIC errors (#1764).
    Right now all gRPC servers are stopped when they receive a non-temporary error
    from the acceptor socket. Unfortunately, after introducing QUIC we forgot to
    check whether this invariant is true, and now we suffer from servers
    termination on any QUIC timeout etc.
    This patch should fix random server stopping during some kind of temporary
    network problems.

  * Added: experimental QUIC protocol support (#1724).
    Tread lightly. What is it now? Speak, fool. At last. No one orders me around!
    Introducing QUIC protocol support in most of the components. QUIC is
    an experimental transport layer network protocol, which we use as an
    alternative to TCP to achieve reliable communication between our
    components.
    The main reason to include this is to increase connection establishing
    stability between any 2 peers, which are located under private networks.
    QUIC is designed at top of UDP, which is more predictable and
    investigated for NAT penetration, unlike we do for TCP in a hacky way.
    Since QUIC allows to multiplex many connections into a single socket
    there is no need to penetrate NAT for the same client-server pair
    multiple times. After the first successful attempt, the punched hole will
    be reused.
    The Rendezvous server has been updated to support UDP hole punching using
    QUIC protocol. It additionally exposes its gRPC server on the same UDP
    port as for TCP, since it is possible to reuse ports in case of different
    network protocols used. The wire-level left the same - gRPC.
    Affected components: Worker, Node, Rendezvous. Both Node and Worker now
    expose its gRPC services on both TCP and UDP sockets, the port number is
    the same.
    At last, Windows users now can utilize our NAT punching feature, since
    multiplexed UDP communication does not require SO_REUSEPORT flag. So
    relaying now isn't the only single option for Windows.
    Note, that this feature is currently in an experimental stage. You can
    try it by specifying "SONM_ENABLE_QUIC=true" environment while starting
    Node server.
  * Added: version checking for core components (#1756).
    Currently we often have a situation when our clients (both suppliers and
    customers) don't know whether a new version of the platform has been released.
    To avoid this we've done a simple console notification as a warning about
    whether it's time to update.
  * Added: metrics collection addr and ACL for worker (#1752).
    We must provide metrics collection address to properly set ACLs in worker
    and also be able to collect metrics from whole SONM network.
  * Added: show deal type in deal list cmd (#1749).
    This commit adds the "type" field into the "sonmcli deal list" command.
    The type indicates that the current user is selling or buying resources in
    that deal.
    Closes #1445.
  * Added: announce in the Relay concurrently (#1745).
    Currently, we have a time window where after accepting a relayed connection
    clients are forced to wait until a server publishes itself again. This window
    can be reduced by announcing itself with several connections concurrently. By
    default, the concurrency is set to 2, but it can be increased up to 4 in the
    config.
  * Added: log Worker's ETH address during start up (#1740).
  * Added: background metrics collector for worker (#1715).
    This PR Introduces hardware metrics of the worker, consists of the following
    parts:
    - MetricsHandler plugin bound to worker's instance, it's responsible for
    handling hardware-specific metrics providers (currently for GPUs only),
    updating the whole set of metrics by the timer, return last known state.
    - GRPC method for WorkerManagement API, can be used to retrieve metrics by the
    master or admin address.
  * Fixed: proper ask-plan removal on startup (#1750).
    This PR fixes error during removal of ask-plan on startup due to resource
    change.
  * Fixed: add timeout in Optimus while removing plans (#1755).
  * Fixed: stable smart contract compilation (#1741).
  * Fixed: show master and worker IDs in deal status (#1746).
    Closes #1735.
  * Fixed: replace TCP KA with HTTP2 pings to Rendezvous (#1751).
    Previously we tried to set up TCP keepalive option to ensure that even
    if the NAT closes the connection we're still able to detect it properly.
    However, the library we use to configure SO_REUSEPORT option just
    ignores any keepalive specifications. So we set it, but nothing worked
    properly. All this results in a situation when sometimes during either
    network instability or NAT conntrack configurations the Rendezvous
    server properly detected whether a Worker is disconnected, but the
    Worker itself - was not, otherwise it would try to reconnect.
    This change replaces TCP keepalives with HTTP/2 ping frames, which
    are more portable and works in userland.
  * Fixed: master (#1748).
  * Fixed: deadlock in Rendezvous server (#1739).
    There is a situation where a client no longer awaits the resolution result,
    while there is actually alive server who is ready to establish the connection.
    In this case the communication channel becomes overflowed (because of its
    capacity of 1), which leads to a deadlock.
    This PR fixes that by increasing the capacity to 2. Not the best solution, but
    for now at least it fixes deadlocking.

  * Added: ability to collect metrics from DRI devices (#1697).
    Now we're trying to find hwmon path on the device initialization.
    If we can do this, the monitoring interface for this card became available.
    The "Monitoring" method reads some data from the "/sys/dev" internals, all
    behavior has been ported from the [ROC-smi
    tool](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROC-smi).
  * Added: extended network metrics in Worker (#1691).
    The extended network metrics are now returned when requesting

  * Added: return order IDs after price prediction (#1682).
  * Added: SSH keys management (#1681).
    This PR allows to specify untrusted and leaked ETH addresses that are not
    allowed to be used for remote SSH login. This includes our public test key,
    that is widely used for testing. More can be specified in Worker's config.
  * Added: Optimus should no longer remove active plans (#1679).
    Currently, after the optimization process is done, Optimus replaces some of
    ask-plans with the new ones, dropping currently running deals, which causes
    painful races in the entire SONM network - all running bots are greedily
    engaged on a new profitable order, but only one of them succeeds.
    The new logic in the Worker should eliminate this race, we just support it in
    Optimus. Now it will cancel ask-plans only if there is no deal associated with
    it, delegating other plan management logic to the Worker.
  * Added: SSH on Worker host (#1644).
    Now it is possible to SSH to a Worker using Node proxy, which is especially
    useful for debugging. Internally it works the same way as we did SSH into
    containers, except the user identity, which is now can be a public ETH address
    of a Worker.

  * Fixed: failed genetic model should not interrupt optimization (#1685).
    If a genetic model in Optimus fails to find a genome that has non-zero fitness
    it no longer interrupts the entire optimization process, instead writing a log
    message.
    This should also fix an issue in the price predictor.
  * Fixed: proper version for nvidia plugin (#1678).
    Fixes a situation when nvidia drivers was updated, but docker knows about the

  * Added: forward deals support in Optimus (#1632).
    Now Optimus is capable of optimizing orders that are targeting to forward
    deals in addition to its previous spot-only support. In the config one can
    specify the maximum deal duration that Optimus will take in action.
  * Added: expose DWH API on Node (#1626).
  * Added: add more REST interceptors - logging and tracing (#1623).
  * Added: return REST errors as JSON (#1621).
    This commit slightly changes the REST server behavior by forcing to return
    errors as JSON for the sake of consistency.
    Previously all errors were returned as a plain text. Now set set the
    application/json header and wrap the error into a JSON object.
    Also the encoding/decoding logic was slightly changed - now if a Node is
    configured into secure mode it will return all responses as encoded byte
    array. This was done for symmetry, because one can have a client with encoder,
    and it expects the encoded response. Previously if a request failed in URI
    parsing stage a plain-text reply was returned. That was unexpected and
    completely helpless for people that try to work with secure Node in insecure
    manner. The error says something, but anyway you're unable to do anything with
    the Node unless you have a client-side encoder/decoder.
  * Added: enable some of gRPC interceptors for REST (#1620).

  * Added: generalized log parser for Connor. (#1595).
    This commit removes particular log parser with a single one with a subset of
    settings which can be applied to (almost) any logs with a number in their
    fields.
    Log reader now has 3 options related to logline analyzing:
    1. String pattern to detect line with logs. E.g: line that has 'Total speed'
    in it will be analyzed, if it doesn't - we'll skip this line.
    2. Field number in line. Describes which position in a string is a numeric
    value that shows task quality (hash rate, actually).
    3. The multiplier for parsed value. Used when a field contains the value in
    KHash/s or MHash/s. Use "1" if the multiplier is not applicable for the value.
  * Added: show trace info in Rendezvous logs (#1601).
  * Added: price prediction for suppliers (#1594).

    If "no_cancel" parameter is enabled, Connor will adapt orders that not fits in

  * Changed: single shot ask plans (#1541).
    This PR changes ask-plan behavior, now after the order is canceled,
    or a deal is closed ask plan is removed. This should work better with
    Optimus bot, as it does continuous optimization and also simplifies the code,
    allowing to make separate scheduling for forwarding deals.
  * Fixed: set proper status on container exit (#1643).
  * Fixed: chunked deals fetching in Optimus (#1642).

  * Fixed: zero values in DWH (#1638).
  * Fixed: race condition while resetting puncher (#1637).

    while crossing over and mutating genomes.
  * Fixed: default value for new benchmarks in Optimus (#1610).
    When we add a new benchmark, Worker is required to be restarted to update

    Several weeks ago a new bug was introduced in Relay server - half of the
    remote peer sockets were leaked forever. This was because of improper
    synchronization during rendezvous point, where both remote server and client
    are met. So when a client did its job we closed only a server socket, not the
    client one and vise-verse.
    This patch fixes such behavior - everything should work fine from now, at
    least with dead socket collection.
    Closes #1566.
  * Fixed: handle error if failed to create a new account (#1583).
  * Fixed: check for deal existence before processing (#1557).
    We can get a race when "waitForDeal"'s timer ticks after the

    Deal will be traited as externally opened and its processing will be started.
    Then waitForDeal will make a tick, detected new deal opened for known order
    and add the same deal to the processing. This commit adds check that deal is
    not in the state storage before starting the processing routine.

  * Added: introducing GetOrdersByIDs method in DWH (#1570).
    This PR introduces a method to DWH API that allows you to get orders with
    required IDs.
  * Added: replace "--out=json" with just "--json" flag (#1559).
  * Added: update ethereum, build on go 1.11 (#1564).
    Now the project can be built on go 1.11.
  * Added: print CPU model in worker devices cmd (#1563).
    Closes #1521.
  * Added: password flag for sonmcli login command (#1551).
    This commit adds able to pass "--password=topsecret" flag for "sonmcli login"
    command.
    Useful for auto-installer script.
  * Added: keep internal state for Connor (#1545).
  * Added: dwh stats handle (#1540).
    The new GetStats() handle returns current DWH stats.
  * Added: activate nice market API on Worker matcher (#1534).
    This allows to see why a Worker's matcher failed to open a deal, instead
    of just "transaction failed".
  * Added: show CPU cryptonight benchmark in CLI (#1536).
  * Added: gRPC rate limiter (#1525).
    This commit allows restricting Worker and Node services usage by specifying
    rate limiter interceptor, which can be configured for taking in action both
    global and precise settings - for each method differently.
    This is required to avoid some dumb DOS attempts, however, not ideal.
    The idea is to keep RPS counter for each remote peer that is identified by ETH
    address, which we can extract from the request. The counter has EWMA
    internally, which is good for an npredictable load profile. Then this EWMA
    exceeds the specified threshold an "Unavailable" error is returned.
    Closes #1495.
  * Added: btrfs based storage quotas (#1034).
    It's based on Btrfs subvolumes and quota groups limits. Each subvolume can
    have its own limit (Docker sets this limit if you ask) and several subvolumes
    can be added to a quota group to have a shared limit.
    https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Quota_support Playing with quota
    groups allows us to provide a shared limit.
    When a container is created we lookup its rootfs directory. WARNING: Docker
    does not expose this API, so some dark magic applied to fetch btrfs graph
    driver related information.
    We extract this information by reading files inside graph driver directory.
    DealID is used as quota group id. We allocate new group if it does not exist.
    A subvolume with roofs of the container is assigned to this group. When
    container dies we remove this subvolume from quota group. If the quota group
    is empty, it's deallocated.
  * Fixed: reduce bid price predictor deviation (#1571).
    Bid price predictor is now trained on BID orders that were successfully
    converted into deals. This should reduce the deviation between the predicted
    price and the actual one.
    Also Optimus is now trained on BID orders, while previously all active orders
    were used.
  * Fixed: memory leak in Node and everywhere (#1572).
    Node and other servers under the medium/high load should no longer suffer from
    a memory leak.
  * Fixed: calculate uptime only when benchmarks is finished (#1561).
  * Fixed: proper version var for cli (#1560).
    Closes #1537.
  * Fixed: show change request price in USD/h (#1562).
    Closes #1507.
  * Fixed: use global timeout for task list cmd (#1558).
  * Fixed: restore 13-th benchmark for Connor (#1538).
  * Fixed: restore setting version in apps (#1533).
    Suddenly, go doesn't allow to set a nested variable through link arguments,
    only strings.
  * Fixed: do not build linux-only tests everywhere (#1529).
  * Fixed: remove extra benchmark from Connor's config (#1526).
    Should be added in #1512.
  * Fixed: always expand config path (#1519).
    Previously if user specifies config path like "~/config/node.yaml", service
    cmd wrapper wasn't threated "~" as home dir. This commit fixes this issue.
  * Fixed: proper xdocker.Reference marshalling (#1524).
    This commit fixes xdocker.Reference marshalling in the way it can be used via
    json and yaml encoders.

sonm-core (0.4.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added: restrict Optimus CPU usage via cgroup (#1244).
    This commit allows restricting Optimus CPU usage via cgroups from the
    config.
    Since Optimus can consume a significant amount of CPU this can be useful
    for semi-automatic resource restrictions.
  * Added: disabled anti-fraud modules in Connor (#1370).
    This commit adds null log and pool processors for Connor's anti-fraud
    module.
    It can be used for testing purposes or if the user wants to run
    custom (non-mining) tasks with external quality tracking.
  * Added: detect duplicate orders in Optimus (#1359).
    During learning the following situation may appear: there are a set of
    orders that are planned to replace existing ones, but some of them are
    technically equal, i.e. have the same resources, price, and duration.
    Current Optimus just replaces ask-plans, which results in deal
    cancellation, which is not good.
    This commit teaches Optimus to detect duplicate orders when it's time to
    replace ask-plans with more profitable ones and not to touch them if any.
  * Added: store Connor's task logs (#1390).
  * Added: NPP metrics in Node (#1392).
    This commit adds NPP metric collection on a client side, allowing to
    see how exactly connections are established, which kind of NAT punching
    tool was used and how much time it was consumed. Also, there is a new
    service in Node - monitoring, where one can fetch collected metrics.
  * Added: counterparty address for Connor's orders (#1401).
    This commit adds an ability to set counterparty address and place orders
    only for the required supplier. Also, migration code was added.
    If a user wants to change non-main benchmark or set counterparty or change
    netflags, Connor should be able to detect that new requirements are
    changed.
    It reached with partial order hashing when we decide to restore existing
    order or not.
  * Added: worker address flag for CLI (#1431).
    This PR adds an ability to specify custom worker address in CLI to work
    with.
  * Added: add push_on_stop flag to container desc (#1426).
    This PR introduces a push_on_stop flag to task specification that makes
    pushing to remote repository conditional.
  * Added: verbose filtering in Optimus (#1443).
  * Added: log requests in Rendezvous (#1455).
  * Added: extended status for Worker (#1456).
    This commit extends status method with following data:
    - Master and admin addresses.
    - Are benchmarks passed?
    - Is the master address confirmed?
    We are forced to start gRPC server before benchmarks passed and master
    confirmed.
    Now, on worker's startup, only WorkerManagement service will be registered,
    and no NPP listener used.
    When all of the setup routines completed, we're closing gRPC server and
    re-create it with fully-registered services and NPP listener.
  * Added: generate SSH key instead of requiring (#1462).
    This commit simplifies SSH server configuration on a Worker by deprecating
    "private_key_path" option in "ssh" section. Now SSH key is generated at
    Worker startup and cached in boltdb.
  * Added: Connor's log processor for xmrig (#1472).
    This commit adds a new log processor type for Connor's anti-fraud module.
    Brand new processor able to read logs from the xmrig miner, which is used
    to mine Monero (cryptonight) on CPUs.
  * Changed: process blockchain in Worker in parallel (#1377).
    This PR enables parallel blockchain processing in the salesman, which
    results in a boost in massive ask-plan creation or purging.
  * Changed: show tags in orders list (#1503).
  * Fixed: proper deal closing when a price is changed in Connor (#1352).
    Such problem occurs in the following conditions: Connor detects price
    deviation and starts replacing orders, also it starts to close
    non-profitable deals. When the deal is closed, a worker on another
    side can pick the order that we schedule for cancellation. This order
    is turned into a deal that immediately will be closed because of the low
    price. So this shitfall will perform until all of the orders isn't
    replaced. This commit fixes that behavior: now Connor checks that the
    cancel chan is empty before really closing an active deal.
  * Fixed: remove repo & tag from an uploaded image (#1353).
  * Fixed: allow gRPC logger to truncate specific methods output (#1360).
  * Fixed: proper (un)marshaling for empty SSH keys (#1375).
    This commit fixes couple bugs introduced in #1281.
    - Failed to start a task without providing ssh pubkey.
    - Marshalling an empty pubkey crashes worker.
  * Fixed: show allocated resources in TaskStatus (#1368).
    This commit fills the `AllocatedResources` field from the deal's ask-plan.
    Actual resources info gives an ability to show what part of deal's
    resources are acquired by task, at least what GPUs is used.
  * Fixed: properly parse docker load output (#1373).
  * Fixed: kill tasks if deal was closed (#1387).
  * Fixed: proper init for disabled processor in Connor (#1388).
  * Fixed: Node hanging on failed startup (#1395).
    This commit fixes race when Node starts with some failed condition, for
    example, when SSH port is occupied, and then hangs forever.
  * Fixed: properly close read/write part of sockets in Relay (#1398).
  * Fixed: proper deal id comparison (#1408).
  * Fixed: socket leak in Node (#1424).
    This commit fixes socket leakage in Node by draining pending channels in
    case of timeout errors.
  * Fixed: unregister closed deal despite the result of order deregistration (#1433).
    Due to some strange circumstances, that could be possible if we received
    stale data from blockchain after deal registration, or failed to save data
    in boltdb, an order could be removed before a deal, resulting in a
    neverending cycle of deal removal. This PR fixes this behavior.
  * Fixed: restore deals only if Connor is a consumer (#1427).
  * Fixed: proper task tag printer (#1451).
  * Fixed: proper error if the profile doesn't exist (#1450).
  * Fixed: proper identity level checking worker SSH (#1444).
    This commit fixes invalid identity level verification while performing SSH
    access to a container using NPP API.
    Previously an identity level of ask-plan was checked, while actually it
    must be the consumer's level checked.
  * Fixed: properly detect IPv4 addresses (#1460).
    For some unknown reasons, Go developers keep IPv4 addresses in a slice of
    size 16(!). It's so logical, yes.
  * Fixed: the proper formula for XMR price calculation (#1459).
    This commit fixes calculation algo for XMR.  Also, a signature of the
    PriceProvider's `calculateFunc` has been changed because we want to use
    all available token params, not only reward and net difficulty.
  * Fixed: proper env params applying in Connor (#1474).
  * Fixed: restrict image push with KYC level (#1458).
    This PR introduces ACL which checks KYC level and allow only users of a
    specific level to push custom images on the worker. Also, it's made
    configurable and it is reused in whitelist configuration.
  * Fixed: drop task if the deal was closed during startup (#1476).
    This PR fixes bug, when a deal was closed during task start and the task
    was not released properly.
  * Fixed: underflow in price prediction service (#1498).
  * Fixed: show all balances when with output=JSON (#1500).
  * Fixed: keep container info after task stop (#1441).
  * Fixed: activate onCertificateUpdated handler in DWH (#1502).
  * Fixed: configurable EWMA for Connor's processor (#1478).
  * Fixed: properly initialize tinc network (#1505).
    This PR fixes ability to add tinc network alongside shaped interface. As
    Docker does not accept multiple networks during container creation we do
    connect them afterward.
  * Fixed: log the supplier's address in Connor (#1510).
    This commit extends Connor's logger (bounded to a deal) with the supplier
    eth address.
    Also, use proper logger instance in the `startTaskOnce` method.
  * Fixed: proper logging on price deviation in Connor (#1511).
    Early we logging price-per-second-per-hash from the PriceProvider,
    this commit replaces this value with full order price per second which
    is more easy for future analysis.
  * Fixed: proper log processor for Connor (#1514).
    This commit fixes several issues with log processor:
    - Wrap calculated hashrate value with atomic to make it thread-safe.
    - Perform initializing tick for EWMA.
    - Add timestamps for stored logs.
    - Read logs with tail. It prevents us from reloading full task log when
      Connor restarts or when connection was lost and Connor should start
      read logs again.
  * Fixed: proper systemd config (#1516).

sonm-core (0.4.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added: DWH L2 (#1295).
    DWH now stores events history, allowing to perform data analysis over the
    entire history of our sidechain.
  * Added: close unprofitable deals in Connor (#1310).
    This activates price checking for Connor's deals.
    If mining profit becomes less that we paying for a deal - Connor will close
    it without adding the supplier to the blacklist.
  * Added: XMR price provider for Connor (#1321).
    This commit replaces incompleted ZEC's price provider with the XMR one.
    Also, this commit replaces ZEC token with XMR_CPU in the config.
  * Added: activate request logging in Relay (#1329).
    Now all gRPC requests will be logged as they come.
  * Added: info handle in Relay (#1328).
    This addition activates info handle in Relay server, allowing to view
    current server's state, similar how we do in Rendezvous.
  * Added: blockchain errors for humans while opening a deal (#1291).
    This commit activates special interceptor on Node that performs userland
    verification before opening a deal. This allows returning human-readable
    errors instead of just "Transaction failed" in case of where it is
    impossible for some reasons to open a deal, which helps to figure out
    what's exactly wrong in two orders and why they cannot match.
  * Added: relative price threshold in Optimus (#1334).
    This commit allows specifying either absolute or relative price threshold
    in Optimus.
    It works the following way: if Optimus finds a new more profitable orders
    set it looks at the relative price difference in percents between the new orders set and the existing one.
  * Added: price predictor service (#1254).
    This commit allows to optionally activate order price predictor service
    on Node.
    This service is capable of continuous training on current marketplace's
    state to be able to predict an order price from its benchmarks and
    netflags.
    A simple multidimensional regression model with non-negative coefficients
    is used.
    It is exposed as a separate gRPC/REST service and can be accessed the same
    way others methods are.
  * Added: allow passing output to the logger (#1348).
    This commit extends logger config with the desired output.
    Can be "stdout" as it previously works, or it can be a path to log file.
    Logs are written to the stdout will be colorized. However, redirected
    descriptors are automatically detected, switching off colorizing if a new
    descriptor is not a TTY.
  * Added: remove extra orders in Connor (#1355).
    This commit brings code that looks at the desired and existing order sets
    which present on the Market and decide what orders should be removed.
    Extra orders can appear when the configured hash rate range was changed,
    for example by decreasing.
  * Added: parallel order and deal purging (#1354).
    This PR extends order and deal API, providing an ability to remove several
    orders and deals at a time (including full purge). This is done on Node in
    a parallel manner reducing the time needed for operation.
  * Added: SSH into containers through Node (#1216).
    This allows performing SSH'ing into containers by specifying only deal
    and task identifiers independent of wherever those containers are being
    run.
    This is done by proxying the traffic through local Node.
    The idea is to hijack to incoming TCP connection with further resolving the
    real endpoint of a Worker where a container is being run by deal ID
    using NPP with further traffic forwarding directly into it. The Worker may
    not be having a public IP address.
    This is an experimental feature and should be optionally activated both on
    Worker and on Node. Note, that on Node you should also configure an SSH
    agent to be able to obtain credentials with which an access into a
    container will be performed.
  * Changed: show only public IPs in deal status (#1335).
    Previously all networks including private were shown, but such information
    is completely unusable.
  * Changed: drop excessive logging in Connor (#1333).
  * Changed: start services when the network becomes online (#1336).
    This change touches the default systemd configuration, forcing our services
    to start strictly after the network is fully configured and upon a system.
  * Changed: mark node's Balance method as deprecated (#1357).
    Use BalanceOf instead, which is more flexible and allows to specify the
    target address.
  * Fixed: counterparty matching in DWH (#1315).
    After this fix, DWH should properly match orders, doing the proper identity
    level check.
  * Fixed: zero creator identity level in DWH (#1317).
    Now a meaningful value is used instead of just zero.
  * Fixed: gradually decrease blacklisting in Connor (#1318).
    This commit fixes worker unblacklisting in the following way:
    each tracked success decreasing the next possible blacklist step by the
    value of time in which task was correctly worked.
    Each failure doubles a period of time in which a worker will be placed on
    the blacklist.
    So if a worker is unblacklisted after the previous failure (1hr) and
    correctly work for 30 minutes, then, next blacklist time is 2hr minus
    30 minutes.
  * Fixed: treat none benchmarks as min in Optimus (#1322).
    This fixes a bug when Optimus created ask-plan for orders that specified
    CPU cores benchmark with the value greater than on the system. That results
    in order that can't be matched with the target one.
  * Fixed: support old samba servers (#1327).
    This fixes a bug when specifying "vers" option for CIFS plugin resulted in
    an error (seen in dmesg) that CIFS doesn't support "vers" option.
    This means that either too old CIFS compatibility layer is installed or
    there is an old smb server.
    Now we just ignore unspecified "vers" option.
  * Fixed: Connor should ban worker if cannot start a task (#1326).
  * Fixed: proper CertificateUpdated event processing (DWH) (#1331).
  * Fixed: attach antifraud to restarted task (#1330).
    Previously, if the task was restarted antifraud module does not restart log
    processing for the new task instance. This commit fixes that behavior.
  * Fixed: use flags to control blacklisting in Connor (#1332).
    This commit adds extendable flags to control the antifraud behavior in
    different cases. Also, it fixes a problem when we blacklisting a worker
    which picks-up a deal which we decide to re-create due to price changes.
  * Fixed: proper order price setting in Connor (#1337).
    This commit moves a price calculation code into a "sendOrderToMarker" method,
    it allows us to calculate the actual price on each order re-creation.
    Also, it fixes a bug when Connor replaces order on price deviation by an
    order with absolute same parameters.
  * Fixed: show DWH endpoint in worker status (#1343).
    Now we show actual DWH endpoint instead of a blank line.
  * Fixed: remove IFB dev on ask-plan remove (#1347).
    We use IFB (intermediate functional block) devices for more smooth traffic
    shaping. However, they were not properly collected after the associated
    ask-plan is removed, which led to garbaging on a system with dead link
    devices.
    Now everything should be properly cleared.
  * Fixed: no peer found error in Relay (#1350).
    Such error appeared when a server was under pressure. It worked the
    following way: a server announced itself and waited for a connection.
    When a client came it consumes that connection, causing "noPeerFound"
    errors for other clients that tried to resolve a server at the same time.
    This commit fixes that behavior by putting clients into a short-waiting
    queue. In the future, we can improve this by checking whether a server was
    ever seen by Relay.
  * Fixed: proper task start in Connor (#1349).
    This commit increases task starting timeout and makes it configurable.
    Also, on "StartTask" retrying we'll check that previous attempt doesn't
    really start a task.
  * Fixed: increase connection timeout in Connor (#1358).
  * Fixed: allow NetworkIn only with public IPv4 addresses (#1342).

sonm-core (0.4.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added: network shaping (#1280).
    This enables network traffic shaping on a worker, making it possible to limit
    network bandwidth for each deal separately.
    Internally this is achieved using linux kernel traffic control mechanism and
    making friendship with Docker.
    At the first attempt, we achieved this by using policing, which drops excess
    packets, throttling TCP window sizes and reducing the overall output rate of
    affected traffic streams. Overly aggressive burst sizes (which is tricky to set
    properly) led to excess packet drops and throttle the overall output rate,
    particularly with TCP-based flows.
    All the above is relevant to the TBF (token bucket filtering) classless discipline,
    which is the easiest way to shape network traffic.
    An alternative approach is using the HTB (hierarchical token bucket) queueing
    discipline, which is classful and allows to build hierarchical rules for traffic
    shaping and policing. For egress traffic, intermediate functional block (IFB)
    devices are used which has separate packet queueing.
    All this allows both to build hierarchical rules for each packet type, network
    device, etc; and moreover to restrict traffic for each container and/or for the
    entire worker.
    It is clear for now that both direction shaping works without packed dropping
    spikes. Epic win.
    After an ask plan is created the following actions are performed:
    - Create bridge device with its own iptables rules, where all containers for
      a specific deal will live. This bridge allows tasks to communicate with
      each other, but not with tasks spawned within another deal. For that purposes,
      you have to use overlay network drivers.
    - Apply TC rules to that bridge, that will limit ingress traffic. Yep, ingress,
      because container's egress traffic seems as an ingress traffic for the Docker
      device.
    - Create IFB virtual device.
    - Mirror egress traffic to that IFB by applying TC filters and create another
      rule for that traffic.
  * Added: print order identity in CLI (#1286).
  * Added: allow obtaining balance by specified wallet (#1294).
    This commit extends Node API to be able to call blockchain's "balanceOf"
    with given eth address as a parameter. On the CLI-side there is still a
    single method but with an optional extra parameter.
  * Added: network shaping for BTFS (#1299).
    This commit activates network shaping for BTFS volume plugin.
    Previously BTFS was run under a separate bridge network, which was not
    connected with the network under which the deal tasks are being executed.
    However, now we are capable of performing task's network shaping under the
    constraints specified in a supplier's order.
    This commit changes the previous behavior with starting BTFS container
    under the same network with the task it manages, so network limitations
    should properly work.
  * Added: prometheus metrics for Connor (#1296).
    This adds Prometheus metrics which gives us some info about orders and
    deals lifespans.
  * Added: simulation mode in Optimus (#1308).
    This commit allows Optimus to be executed in simulation mode, fetching
    only specified orders from the marketplace.
    Also fixed a bug when Optimus removed ask-plans in dry-run mode.
  * Added: update price changes in Optimus (#1307).
    This teaches Optimus to update auto-accepted price changes for deals.
    Previously it only considers a price specified in ask-plan, not the real
    one, which may change during deal's lifetime.
  * Changed: default DWH config update (#1288).
  * Changed: tune dry-run in Optimus (#1301).
    Now Optimus while being run under dry-run option will show removing
    candidates ask-plans.
  * Fixed: parse BID and ASK strictly (#1282).
    This fixes a bug when a user can accidentally create BID or ASK with
    fields that are unknown to the Node/Worker. Such behavior is a source of
    confusion and frustration, so we just forbid unknown fields when
    doing "sonmcli order create" and "sonmcli worker ask-plan create".
  * Fixed: properly calculate free devices in Optimus (#1285).
    This fixes a bug where during the calculation of free devices a mutation
    of meant-to-be-immutable field occurs, which lead to improper free devices
    state.
    As a side effect, one could see that Optimus performed invalid optimization
    in the case where the most optimal ask-plans already exist.
  * Fixed: sudden EOF while connecting through NPP (#1253).
    The problem is - both client and server successfully connect to each other,
    so there are at least 2 different connections.
    The server must serve both of them with further dropping the hanging one.
    The client must return the first one and close another.
    If we are a server - we just put the successful connection in a queue and
    return on next "Accept" called.
    If we are a client - do as we did before.
  * Fixed: processor shutdown in DWH (#1270).
    Hitting Ctrl-C could lead to a long and painful shutdown if DB and other
    resources were closed before the last iteration of the processor loop. This
    problem is fixed by making sure that the processing loop is fully locked,
    not just its parts.
  * Fixed: proper blacklisting in Connor (#1292).
    This fixes the blacklist timer behavior on failures and successes.
    Also, resetting the timer if a user was un-blacklisted on the market.
  * Fixed: properly discover loopback links (#1297).
    This fixes a bug where our components, like Node and Worker resolved
    loopback devices using self-localhost-resolution.
    This sometimes led to a problem on systems with disabled IPv6 but
    misconfigured /etc/hosts.
  * Fixed: proper BTFS initialization (#1298).
    This fixes error ignoring while initializing BTFS volume plugin.
  * Fixed: proper JSON errors for task list cmd (#1300).
  * Fixed: check BID identity level in Optimus (#1287).
    This is required due to #1293.
  * Fixed: proper order cancel in Connor (#1306).
  * Fixed: proper own ask filtering in Optimus (#1312).
    Optimus should no longer create plans for its own asks.

  * Added: feat: BTFS volume plugin for Worker (#1274).
    This commit activates an ability to spawn SONM tasks with torrent
    filesystem attached as a volume.
    Internally this is achieved by using BTFS application that constructs a
    torrent client and mounts itself on a filesystem via fuse. It's the
    read-only solution designed to distribute large amount of data across
    multiple task without single point of failure - all tasks help each
    other to share the data, which reduces network pressure and improves
    application scalability.
  * Added: enable pprof for Node (#1272).
  * Changed: update gRPC library (#1258).
  * Fixed: proper config for Connor (#1265).
  * Fixed: proper Connor's binary path in systemd-unit (#1271).
  * Fixed: load keystore even if "--insecure" flag is set (#1276).
    This commit fixes a problem when "--insecure" flag is used
    with the CLI and some sub-command wants to load a key or
    obtain a default eth address from the key store.
    Therefore, now we'll load keystore prematurely for any command.
    Now if insecure mode is activated, only TLS credentials creation
    will be skipped for gRPC's client connection.
  * Fixed: show Order's price per hour (#1277).

sonm-core (0.4.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added: Connor, the auto-buy mining bot (#1227).
    This introduces Connor, the bot which buying resources for mining. The
    current implementation can:
     - Places BID orders according to config.
     - Restores orders, deals, and tasks between restarts.
     - Loads actual price of the target token, create orders according to
       price and marginality coefficient.
     - Tracks token price changes using CoinMarketCap, re-create orders if
       the price changed sufficiently.
     - Looks for actual hashrate by logs and mining pool statistics.
     - Closes deals which give us less hash-rate than offered.
    Note that current implementation is strongly coupled with the Ethereum
    mining on the DwarfPool.
    Next, we'll make it more modular and configurable for other popular tokens
    and pools.
  * Added: enable pprof in Optimus (#1255).
  * Changed: fast benchmark mapping in Optimus (#1256).
    Added smart benchmark mapping algorithm, which indexes benchmarks in a flat
    map backed with array.
    This increases performance of genetic algorithm in 2-3 times.
  * Changed: use proper combinations limits in Optimus (#1261).
    It doesn't make sense to building combinations of GPUs with k more than n,
    which is the length of currently free GPUs.
  * Changed: avoid extra copying in Optimus (#1262).
  * Fixed: avoid global logger in puncher (#1252).
    After this fix no strangely formatted logging messages should appear.
  * Fixed: nil pointer dereferencing in Optimus (#1257).
  * Fixed: find leaf node in Optimus even with no price (#1260).
  * Fixed: use context without timeout for stream methods (#1263).

sonm-core (0.4.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added: non-negative LLS solver for Optimus (#1090).
    This adds a new more-physically-correct optimization method - the non-negative
    multidimensional linear least squares (NNLS).
    It constraints the result vector values to be a non-negative, which in its
    turn means that each of them will show to the real benchmark price per
    basis.
    Also this shows an extremely performance boost - million of orders are
    optimized in less than for a second.
  * Added: pre-request logging interceptor (#1229).
    This commit activates automatic request logging for gRPC services. This
    includes logging service and request names with tracing attributes if
    activated. Both unary and streaming API are supported.
    Internally this is done by using gRPC request interceptors, that are
    invoked before the actual method called.
  * Added: optionally expand deal's orders in CLI (#1238).
    The new flag "--expand" works as follows: if specified it also fetches
    information about both BID and ASK orders in a deal and prints it.
  * Added: genetic optimization in Optimus (#1234).
    This commit introduces a new genetic optimization algorithm helping
    Optimus to find the best orders set.
    The core idea is to create multiple knapsack populations with random
    orders inside and try to pack them. Failed populations should die, while
    successful ones will live. Sometimes random mutation occurs, which
    results in random order addition or removal from the set. The best
    individuals will cross each other attempting to produce more adapted
    children.
    BEWARE OF DRAGONS: this is quite CPU intensive algorithm, so there are
    predefined generation and age limits. However even with them it may eat
    all your CPU.
    Additionally now it is possible to combine several models to run them
    parallel and to select the best one.
  * Added: branch bound model in Optimus (#1239).
    This adds a new model - Branch Bound Tree, which finds a global optimum
    solution for knapsack problem.
    However, its complexity is still exponential, so it must be activated only
    when the number of matching orders is relatively low.
  * Added: optional tag for task (#1236).
    This allows to specify used-defined tag when starting a task. This tag can
    be fetched back later when monitoring running tasks.
  * Changed: make masterchain gas price configurable (#1195).
    This option now useful for deposit and gatekeeper withdraw;
    If option not defined gas price is determined by the latest blocks median
    gas price.
  * Changed: add comments in default bid config (#1233).
  * Changed: reduce default price threshold in Optimus (#1235).
    The new value is equivalent of ~0.48$ per day or 175.2$ per year.
  * Changed: Optimus config description - init everything from config (#1240).
    Now the "optimization" settings can be specified to each worker Optimus
    monitor independently.
    The config itself now allows to specify much more things.
    Changed regression settings (previous "classifier"), it was slightly
    flattened.
    Also dropped "optimization.interval" option.
    It is highly recommended to switch to the new config instead of using old
    ones because otherwise some settings will fall back to defaults.
  * Changed: drop order fusion from time in Optimus (#1232).
    The removed field from the config was named as "logistic" function.
    This weighted function no longer needed and even considered harmful.
  * Fixed: handle tasks correctly in case of worker reload (#1188).
  * Fixed: add to matching orders existing ones in Optimus (#1248).
    Previously they were added but then immediately filtered out, because those
    orders are ASKs, not BIDs.

sonm-core (0.4.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added: deployment scripts for livenet (#1087).
  * Added: show Ethereum balance on live network (#1203).
    CLI is able to print balance also in Ethereum (for Masterchain).
  * Added: assign tags in Optimus orders (#1209).
  * Added: gas limits in blockchain API (#1200).
  * Added: SNM token transfer for sidechain.
    This commit allows to transfer tokens from the logged in account to another
    address in the Sidechain.
  * Removed: drop sqlite3 support in DWH (#1201).
  * Changed: log order id when creating ask plans in Optimus (#1183).
  * Changed: worker's status handle available for anyone (#1193).
  * Changed: licence changed to GPLv3.
  * Changed: complete Node refactoring (#1202).
    Fixed race conditions while failed to start some parts of the Node
    servers. For example when REST server failed to start there was resource
    leakage.
  * Changed: added default sort to GetWorkers DWH (#1214).
  * Changed: ping worker before deal (#1196).
    Now node will try to connect to the worker before opening deal (both
    OpenDeal and QuickBuy). If a worker is not responding to the status
    request - deal will not be opened and user will be noticed about worker
    unavailability. User can force deal opening with the `--force` flag passed
    to related CLI's sub-commands.
  * Fixed: classify for all orders, not only matching in Optimus (#1180).
  * Fixed: assign created timestamp for worker's own orders in Optimus (#1184).
  * Fixed: properly cut orders with 0 GPU count in Optimus (#1185).
  * Fixed: DWH proper exit (#1167).
  * Fixed: keep task-to-ask-plan data till the deal is finished (#1190).
    When the container dies, or the task is stopped we keep all the task's data
    until the deal is finished, but we don't keep the task-to-ask-plan data
    deleting  in ReleaseTask method. So when we ask for logs or any  other data
    on an already stopped container.
    This patch proposes keeping this info until the deal is closed, so we can,
    for instance, still ask for logs on a stopped container.
  * Fixed: proper logs following (#1206).
  * Fixed: ignore orders with zero price in Optimus (#1204).
  * Fixed: hasActiveCR status for deals in DWH (#1215).
  * Fixed: ignore conflicts on AddedToBlacklist events (DWH).
  * Fixed: oracle config (#1222).
  * Fixed: close puncher after dialing (#1224).
    This should prevent fd leak in Node.
  * Fixed: print ask plan tags as strings (#1226).
    This fixes the previous ask-plan printing behaviour where the "tag" field
    was printed as a byte array, which is not human-readable.
    This is done via type erasure hack with reflection. The only reason this
    is done this way is not to break the backward compatibility.

sonm-core (0.4.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added: blacklist support in Optimus (#1175).
    This change activates blacklists support in Optimus.
    Now orders whose author is in worker's blacklist are now filtered out.
    The same thing happens at the opposite: when the worker's address is in
    the order's blacklist.
  * Changed: better error handling for the cli (#1152).
  * Changed: cli can now read it's config from --config flag (#1162).
  * Changed: adds node_addr config variable to cli (#1163).
  * Changed: no longer strip binaries (#1170).
    This allows to debug binaries via debuggers like delve.
  * Changed: Optimus decomposition (#1165).
    Two-way optimization algorithms introduced here. Its main aim is to
    reduce false-positive ask-plan creation. One way to achieve this is to
    do optimization for both virtual devices and for natural ones.
    Preparing worker input such as fetching its devices and ask-plans are now
    performed concurrently to save some time. Its duration is limited using
    new option: "prelude_timeout".
    Fetching orders from the DWH is now performed on-demand, however caching
    still exists.
  * Changed: disable Node's REST encryption (#1173).
  * Fixed: relay check matching node (#1046).
    It might be the case that cluster reconfigures between Discover and
    Handshake; this PR checks that we only work with appropriate peers.
    It also adds dial retries for clients that experienced Discover/Handshake
    inconsistency.
  * Fixed: properly join host with port everywhere (#1168).
    In case of IPv6 addresses it properly wraps the given address with [] braces.
  * Fixed: avoid extra request for worker if user is not consumer (#1172).
    This commit adds checking that current user's key is a consumer key,
    if so - the node will try to connect to the related worker using NPP,
    otherwise - skip connection.
  * Fixed: spurious continuum devastation (#1177)
    This fixes a bug in the Relay server, when it suddenly devastates the
    continuum, returning 0.0.0.0 on any discovery request.
    Also it fixes a bug introduced in #1046, when an improperly configured node
    stopped to work.

sonm-core (0.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added: gate with daily limit and freeze (#1062).
  * Added: DWH extended validators (#1063).
  * Added: ask-plan cancellation in Optimus (#1072).
    This change activates ask-plan cancellation mechanism in Optimus.
    It works the following way. Periodically Optimus scans workers it manages
    and determines whether some ask-plans can be replaced in the nearest
    future. If so - it calculates virtual free devices and tries to optimize
    the new orders set (including already existing) to determine which
    ask-plans are required to be replaced.
  * Added: dry-run option in Optimus (#1078).
    When activates Optimus will not create ask plans, but continues doing the
    rest calculations instead. Useful for debugging.
  * Added: uptime in Relay metrics (#1086).
    Now Relay will return its uptime while answering for its metrics handle.
  * Added: worker debug state (#1084).
    This PR adds handle to worker to retrieve useful debugging info, e.g.
    current resource scheduler state and salesman state.
  * Added: gate commission (#1097).
  * Added: feat: contract registry (#1110).
    This PR replaces static smart contract addresses with contract registry
    smart contract, which is loaded on start and caches all dependant addresses.
  * Added: ability to drop benchmark cache (#1115).
  * Added: oracle (#1082).
    This implementation works through MultiSig contract.
  * Added: add ask plan timestamps (#1134).
    This PR adds creation timestamp orderPlaced timestamp and function to get
    time for which order has not been sold, which can be useful for Optimus.
  * Added: cancel stale ask-plans on Optimus (#1146).
    Note, that failed cancellation does not break current bot's epoch.
  * Changed: flexible benchmarks (#1066).
    This PR allows worker to perform and cache benchmarks separately for each device
    and enables parallel benchmarking for GPU.
  * Changed: decompose components logic in Optimus (#1071).
    This change allows to create multiple worker clients with different account settings.
  * Changed: simplify weight formula in Optimus (#1077).
    Previously a quite complicated motivation was used to calculate order
    weights. It was hard to understand, and een harder to debug.
    Now we use a simple predictedPrice/price as a criteria of order's
    attractiveness.
  * Changed: more verbose cmd errors in Optimus (#1092).
  * BREAKING Changed: extend NPP identifier with protocol (#1104).
    This allows to specify some protocol you want to publish/resolve as the
    Rendezvous allows. It is required for further NAT traversal extensions.
    What is changed: not relay protocol allows to specify "protocol" field
    in order to match between different protocols for the same peer ID.
    In both Relay and Rendezvous meeting groups are now associated with
    complex string representation a-la URI.
    This is the BREAKING change. Both Rendezvous, Worker and Node must be
    updated. Relay, however, does not need to.
  * Changed: update task.yaml example (#1138).
  * Changed: show GPU hashes in device list (#1139).
  * Changed: change benchmark names in cli output (#1142).
  * Fixed: Relay server tracking (#1047).
    This PR fixes a Relay bug: connecting servers weren't track'ed on Handshake.
  * Fixed: build DRI module on non-unix (#1074).
  * Fixed: properly forward "expose" section in Worker (#1076).
    This fixes forgetting "expose" section while forwarding it from start task request to a container.
    Also a tiny test added to check whether the task config is parsed properly.
  * Fixed: proper reference parsing (#1075).
    After this fix Worker will use proper reference parsing to detect digested images.
  * Fixed: benchmark processing copy paste (#1079).
  * Fixed: treat GPU count in Optimus as min (#1083).
    We have a special business crutch, which forced us to treat GPU count
    benchmark as a maximum allowed number of GPUs to match bid with ask, i.e.
    if a bid requires for example 2 GPUs a worker can sell either 1 or 2 of
    any matching its GPUs.
    This commit inverts this logic to the default marketplace logic. No we
    treat such benchmark as a minimum required number of GPUs.
  * Fixed: properly process price for validators (#1085).
  * Fixed: properly handle zero GPU benchmark (#1088).
    This fixes a bug where Optimus fails to fit GPU benchmarks with some of
    them equal zero.
  * Fixed: deploy list contract (#1080).
  * Fixed: Optimus will now set identity level (#1091).
  * Fixed: enable TCP keep-alive for Relay clients (#1095).
    Setting TCP keepalive is strictly suggested, because in case of mobile
    devices the network can be reconfigured multiple times between connection
    attempts.
    However if the network was silently changed or the connection was lost or
    the other side was kernel-panicked no FIN/RST will be delivered to us,
    which leads to infinite (well, 24-hour) hanging.
  * Fixed: use proper market API in Optimus (#1099).
    Accidentally we used gRPC API to the DWH instead of blockchain API.
  * Fixed: benchmark casting precision issue (#1101).
  * Fixed: skip non-dir files when observing /sys/class/drm (#1106).
  * Fixed: proper check for worker availability for the deal (#1102).
    This commit adds a check that worker is available when the user making
    deal with `quick-buy` handle.
    Also, this commit remove a message that warns the user about the worker
    inaccessibility when showing deal list.
  * Fixed: case insensitive name search for profiles (DWH) (#1108).
  * Fixed: cli login must ask for default key's pass (#1100).
    This commit fixes a bug which can happen in such case:
    key storage by given path already have a key but the config is empty.
    Previously, cli marked the first available key as default one without checking a password
    (user is able to decrypt their key), and also **does not** writes the state into the `cli.yaml`.
    Now `cli login` asks for a password for the first key (if not provided),
    and then update `cli.yaml` if decryption is successful.
  * Fixed: increase timeout for deposits command (#1113).
    This commit increases timeout for `sonmcli token deposit`
    method. The average time of command execution is about 100s with
    a default timeout of 60s. So for a user it looks like that command
    is always failing.
  * Fixed: limit min number of orders for optimization in Optimus (#1118).
  * Fixed: proper GPU mem benchmark handling in Optimus (#1129).
  * Fixed: transaction like consumption in Optimus (#1135).
    When combining orders into a device manager, sometimes, when further
    benchmarks did not fit in the set, Optimus stole those resources, making
    all following attempts to fail with resource exhausted error.
    This commit fixes that behaviour.
  * Fixed: proper value in status channel (#1145).
    This PR fixes behaviour when deal was finished, but task resources were not
    released as status event was not delivered via status channel.

  * Added: Optimus now can filter by counterparty (#977).
  * Added: DWH orders blacklist filters (#978).
  * Added: maintenance for worker (#960).
    This introduces maintenance feature for worker.
    The `./sonmcli maintenance` accepts time point or duration to set maintenance on worker.
    The `./sonmcli next-maintenance` show the time of next planned maintenance.
    All orders durations are being adjusted according to maintenance point.
    After maintenance point all spot deals are closed and all orders are removed.
  * Added: quick buy for cli and node (#990).
    This adds an ability to perform quick buy for given ASK order on market.
  * Added: increase/decrease approval token functions (#1010).
  * Added: multi-sig wallet (#1011).
  * Added: order purge handle for cli and node (#997).
  * Added: optimus price prediction (#1030).
    This allows autosell bot to predict its price based on previous learning
    iteration. It is required for further canceling orders depending on its
    predicted market price.
  * Added: profile management for cli and node (#1002).
  * Added: AnyUserID field for DealsRequest in DWH (#1031).
    This introduces a new search field to DealsRequest: AnyUserID. If provided,
    supplierID, consumerID, and masterID fields are ignored.
    Any of the mentioned IDs must match the provided value.
  * Added: contracts freezing (#1029).
  * Added: add deploy list contract (#1035).
    Smart contract with array of allowed addresses, which may deploy contracts.
  * Added: deposit-withdraw for node and cli (#986).
    This adds able to transfer tokens between masterchain and SONM sidechain.
  * Added: utilize hostname for relay (#1045).
    This change allows to utilize specifying hostnames as a relay address,
    increasing stability.
    Previously such hostname was resolved once at construction time and the
    relay client tried to connect to the resolved TCP addresses even if some
    of them are already down.
    Now each time a client requires new connection hostname resolution occurs.
    All this allows dynamic addition/removal backends under the DNS.
    Of course we try to connect to all returned endpoints.
  * Added: allowance handle for node and cli (#1050).
  * Added: kill option for market contract (#1049).
    This implements destroying of contract. It also returns all frozen funds
    to owner multisig.
    Needs to prevent funds locking while some bug found if any.
  * Changed: reworked benchmarks in market (#964).
    Now we can place orders with any count of benchmarks, but still not more
    than we support.
  * Changed: store netflags in dynamic array on market (#971).
    Now netflags stores in dynamic array. We can update num of netflags without
    both breaking API and redeploy market.
  * Changed: DWH startup refactoring (#929).
    Fixed an minor bug - DWH could crash with segfault after a SIGINT at the
    very startup.
  * Changed: better logs in worker, while requesting approve (#980).
  * BREAKING Changed: implemented GetBlacklistsContainingUser for DWH.
    This is a BREAKING change.
  * Changed: get profile level from contracts (#989).
  * Changed: variable benchmarks in DWH (#984).
    This allows DWH to track current number of benchmarks on Market and handle
    changes properly.
  * Changed: return relay error to the upper layer (#1007).
    This change allows to see what exactly was wrong when a Relay failed to
    establish a connection.
    In conjunction with the #1006 this greatly improves debugging and system
    reaction.
  * Changed: create change request with only price or only duration (#1019).
    Previously, if a user wants to set the new deal price he was forced to
    explicitly set both params: new price and old duration. This adds able to
    propose changes to only one param of a deal.
  * Changed: emulate TCP reaction when using relay (#1006).
    This change improves reaction for connections established using Relay.
    For servers there is no reconnections (except every 24 hours), while for
    clients there an immediate reaction with human-readable error.
  * Changed: print order's tag if present in order status CLI (#1032).
  * Changed: show message if worker has no active tasks (#1037).
  * Changed: implicitly set allowance for market on sidechain (#1042).
    This hook checks and sets allowance for market to practical infinity on every
    method call which requires allowance.
  * Changed: do not apply whitelist to identified consumers (#1040).
    This takes consumer identity level in concern. If customer has at least
    IDENTIFIED level whitelist checking doesn't take place.
  * BREAKING Changed: specify worker settings in Optimus config (#1054).
    Now it is possible to define some worker specific settings in the autosell
    bot config.
    For example now we can specify epoch interval, where the bot scans
    worker's resources and tries to sell them.
  * Changed: bind ask plan storage key to market address (#1052).
  * Changed: spot-only orders for Optimus (#1061).
    Since now Optimus can sell only for spot deals, with zero duration.
  * Fixed: unwrap error in puncher (#966).
  * Fixed: sort GPU to prevent hash changes and re-benchmarking (#963).
  * Fixed: Optimus should now properly cut minimum RAM (#972).
    This fixes a bug where a minimum number of some criteria (for example) RAM
    was too low than the minimum one by one. This is caused by loosing
    precision while converting to float64 and vice-versa - fixed by ceiling
    the result.
    Also found and fixed a bug which caused the Optimus to over-cut celling
    plans, because of invalid math - I used current benchmarks for calculating
    relational criteria, while lower bounds are calculated against total
    devices. Now we use initial benchmarks for this case.
  * Fixed: ceil everything in Optimus (#974).
    This applies previous changes to every other data consumer in the autosell
    bot, so it prevents losing precision while conversing
    from uint64 -> float -> uint64 while doing math.
  * Fixed: fix and refactor netflags (#962).
    This removes odd bool slices conversions in the netflags providing common
    interface to simple uint64.
  * Fixed: update deal after DealChangeRequestAccepted in DWH.
  * Fixed: rework all arithmetic to safe (#979).
    A common protection from overflow.
  * Fixed: log master addr as string, not bytes (#982).
  * Fixed: remove finished benchmark containers from Overseer (#981).
  * Fixed: update deals constantly to prevent caching stale data (#983).
  * Fixed: proper cli login behaviour (#992).
    This fixes two bugs: now we do not mark the key as default if there is
    only one key is present into keystore.
    Also now `sonmcli login` asking for pass-phrase, then trying to decrypt key
    and mark it as default only if decryption was successful.
  * Fixed: incorrect refund when deal closes in Bill transaction (#991).
  * Fixed: autosell bot should now properly list cut ask plans (#999).
  * Fixed: store certificate id in DWH (#1001).
  * Fixed: allow to search zero benchmarks in DWH (#995).
  * Fixed: possible segfault while checking netflags for converse implication.
  * Fixed: proper image load (#1016).
    This fixes `sonmcli tasks push` handle, by using the proper Docker
    method (Push instead of Import, which respects multiple layers as the
    opposite command `docker save` produces).
    Note that this is a BREAKING change. The CLI must be updated.
  * Fixed: do not spool existing images (#1017).
    This fixes a bug when it's impossible to start a previously pushed image
    without it being in the Docker Registry.
  * Fixed: do not spam warnings when no rendezvous specified (#1005).
    This should remove weird warnings like: `failed to construct a puncher {"error": "failed to connect to []"}`.
  * Fixed: list all images, remove excessive logging (#1018).
    There is a situation when you push 2 images one based on another. In this
    case, docker will count the first one as intermediate image and does not
    include in the listing, this fixes this behavior.
  * Fixed: properly load sigmoid settings from the config in autosell bot (#1025).
  * Fixed: proper sigmoid implementation (#1026).
    Autosell bot should no longer fall into millions of NaNs after calculating
    relative order weights.
  * Fixed: do not null order created timestamp (#1027).
    When DWH was young it was unable to return properly created timestamp, we
    inited it ourselves.
    Now times change, but those empty initialization was forgotten and cause
    strange autosell bot behaviour.
    This removes such initialization.
  * Fixed: notify consumer about the worker availability (#1028).
  * Fixed: make relay IPv6 ready (not really) (#1033).
    In case of being run on IPv6 it improperly answers to a discover request
    with address not surrounded with braces.
  * Fixed: get task list only for consumer's deals (#1024).
    We have a situation when `sonmcli task list` is called from the supplier (or master) key.
    At first, to obtain tasks a client needs to load their active deals.
    And then query a tasks list for each deal. So if you a supplier,
    you cannot receive the list by the deal because of ACLs is applied.
    This PR fixes this case by checking that you're a consumer for active deals,
    otherwise, a client will not use that deal for querying tasks.
  * Fixed: optimus should now track incoming network (#1053).
    Previously autosell bot could match more than a single order with incoming
    network required. Because we do not allow such behaviour it led to
    multiple errors while trying to create sell plans.
    This change explicitly disables incoming network after a first matching
    orders found.
  * Fixed: invalid netflag filtering in Optimus (#1064).
    Now Optimus will check for netflags inclusion using free devices instead of
    just devices.

  * Added: quick buy with duration (#957).
  * Changed: pretty-print workers list (#921).
  * Changed: cold-start auto block number in DWH (#930).
    This change makes use of CustomEthereumClient's GetLastBlock() method to
    automatically determine when to build indices in cold start mode.
  * Changed: use blacklists in GetMatchingOrders in DWH (#939).
  * Changed: map gRPC validation error into HTTP invalid argument in REST
    bindings (#952).
  * Changed: attempt to log everything in NPP (#953).
    More logs while connecting using NPP, log details in the Puncher, log
    addresses and protobuf messages as JSON instead of <"\unreadable strings\">.
    NPP errors now filter duplicate error messages, while attempting to punch
    a NAT.
    Also some typos fixed.
  * Changed: extend blacklisting feature (#955).
    Now you can blacklist both master and worker.
  * Fixed: proper logs processing on CLI side (#936).
    This includes proper parsing of hijacked binary logs, restore `type` flag
    functionality and ability to prepend stdout and stderr with corresponding
    prefixes.
  * Fixed: use ask-plan hashing instead of hardware hashing.
    Now we use indexes from ask-plan to determine gpu hash instead of hardware.
    This allows to use GPU indexes as they appear in ask-plan rather than in
    hardware.
  * Fixed: wrong store key in worker config (#941).
  * Fixed: proper format in NetworkSpec printer (#943).
  * Fixed: proper container cleanup on finished deal (#944).
    Fixed a situation when worker did not get deal notification when ask-plan
    was scheduled for deletion.
    Also now worker uses SIGKILL with no regret for tinc as it does not respond
    to ContainerStop anyway.
    This all results in a proper cleanup of the deal containers and resources
    release.
  * Fixed: initialize logger in NPP (#948).
  * Fixed: do not hang on Serve error (#947).
  * Fixed: do not try to use closed deals in Node (#945).
  * Fixed: Node should no longer segfault while working with keystore (#942).
  * Fixed: possible infinite hanging while punching multiple private addresses.
  * Fixed: convert duration to nanoseconds in Optimus (#958).
    Optimus should no longer create ask plans with duration more than one second.
  * Fixed: profile stats and updates in DWH.
    This fixes a bug that happens in the following situation:
      - An order is created for an unknown profile (i.e., AuthorID/MasterID has
        no certificates), so ActiveAsks/ActiveBids is not incremented for that
        profile.
      - A profile is created for that order's AuthorID/MasterID.
      - Order's status changes to INACTIVE, we decrement the already known
        AuthorID/MasterID profile's ActiveAsks/ActiveBids and get a negative
        value.
    The fix goes as follows: when creating a new profile, we count active asks
    and bids and store the new profile with relevant data.
  * Fixed: insert-or-update-validators in DWH (#965).
  * Fixed: GetMatchingOrders Blacklists and CounterpartyID in DWH (#967).

  * Added: unimplemented methods of profiles in smart contracts (#923).
  * Added: debug worker via pprof on demand (#928).
  * BREAKING: DWH now saves MasterID field for orders (#912).
    You should recreate your DWH tables if you use your custom installation.
  * BREAKING: simplify tokens api (#920).
    Now the tokens api uses common.Address instead of string.
    It should help with the common string-to-address casting problem.
  * Changed: use custom Ethereum client everywhere in out internal API (#916).
    This allows to obtain the last block number and the receipt of mined
    transaction.
  * Fixed: incorrect work of QuickBuy smart contract function - wrong
    counterparty was used (#906).
  * Fixed: expand ~ ($HOME) while creating accounts (#907).
  * Fixed: worker defaults in the config are now more relevant (#908).
  * Fixed: Optimus should no longer crash when the training set is degenerated (#911).
  * Fixed: NPP puncher should now properly extract incoming connections (#918).
    This fixes infinite connection hanging from Node to Worker.
  * Fixed: save keystore path if overridden by flag (#924).
    Previously when using `sonmcli login --keystore` with no keys in it, a new keystore
    was created with saving its password as a default. But the path itself was not saved.
    This change fixes that issue.
  * Fixed: limit minimum storage bound in Optimus (#926).

sonm-core (0.4.0-alpha1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added: NAT punching.
    This adds the full NAT Punching Protocol implementation, allowing to
    connect Hub and its clients, including workers, even if they are located under
    a single or several NATs.
    Also this commit adds a Rendezvous server, which acts as an intermediate
    metadata exchange point.
    NPP is a protocol aimed to achieve mutual address resolution for both client
    and server. This is especially useful where there is no guarantee
    that both peers are reachable directly, i.e. behind a NAT for example.
    The protocol allows for servers to publish their private network addresses
    while resolving their real remove address. This information is saved under
    some ID until a connection held and heartbeat frames transmitted.
    When a client wants to perform a connection it goes to this server, informs
    about its own private network addresses and starting from this point a
    rendezvous can be achieved.
    Both client and server are informed about remote peers public and private
    addresses and they may perform several attempts to create an actual p2p
    connection.
    By trying to connect to private addresses they can reach each other if and
    only if they're both in the same LAN or VLAN.
    If a peer doesn't have private address, the connection is almost guaranteed
    to be established directly from the private peer to the public one.
    If both of them are located under different NATs, a TCP punching attempt can
    be performed.
    At last, when there is no hope, for example in the case of Symmetric NAT, a
    special relay server can be used to forward the traffic.
    Servers should publish all of possibly reachable endpoints for all protocols
    they support. Its Ethereum ID is determined automatically through our peer
    authentication mechanism.
    Clients should specify the desired protocol and ID for resolution. For both
    server and client their public endpoint is determined automatically.
    Currently only TCP connection establishment is supported.
    The implementation requires the underlying TCP/IP stack to support
    SO_REUSEADDR and SO_REUSEPORT options, because for successful NAT
    traversal it's crucial to reuse the same src ip:port to be routed
    through the same external ip:port each time.
    Thus, the minimum linux kernel version is 3.9. About other platforms
    it's unclear.
    The other hack is the simultaneous TCP open, which unfortunately requires
    tons of fds allocated on each connect attempt, so prepare to enlarge your
    open files limits.
  * Added: overlay networks support for containers using tinc and/or L2TP.
  * Added: tinc overlay driver (#512).
    The tinc is a Virtual Private Network daemon that uses tunnelling and
    encryption to create a secure private network between hosts on the Internet.
    This addition allows to configure overlay network for containers
  * Added: docker l2tp driver (#490).
    This addition allows to configure overlay L2TP network for containers,
    forcing them to join to the specified VPN.
  * Added: allow worker to manage single GPUs (#491).
    This includes adding GPU Tuner that collects and keep info about available GPUs
    and related DRI devices. We use DRI device representation, related /sys/class parsers
    for device discovering, PCI bus ID extractor.
    The tuner now can bind devices into the container by their IDs.
    Also added `lsgpu` tool for GPU fast-checking on a various systems.
  * Added: allow to obtain peers by ethereum id (#507).
  * Added: feat: NPP Relay server.
    This introduces the Relay server as a part of NPP. Also it extends the NPP library to work
    with it transparently like with a typical TCP socket.
    The Relay server is a last resort tool used to penetrate the NAT in case of
    over-paranoid network configurations, such as Symmetrical NAT or manual iptables
    hacks. When NPP gives up it acts as a third-party server which transports TCP
    traffic in the userland.
    Briefly what it allows - is to establish a TCP connection between two hosts with
    private IP addresses.
    There are several components in the Relay server, which allows to unite several
    servers into the single cluster, performing client-side load-balancing with the
    help of servers.
    After discovering the proper Relay endpoint a HANDSHAKE message is sent to
    publish the server. Internally an ETH address provided is verified using
    asymmetrical cryptography based on secp256k1 curves.
    At the other side the peer client performs almost the same steps, instead of its
    own ETH address it specifies the target ETH address the client wants to connect.
    When at least two peers are discovered the relaying process starts by simply
    copying all the TCP payload without inspection. Thus, an authentication between
    two peers is still required to keep the traffic encrypted and avoid MITM attack.
    Several Relays can be united in a single cluster by specifying several endpoints
    of other members in the cluster the user want to join. Internally a SWIM
    protocol is used for fast members discovering and convergence. An optional
    message encryption and members authentication can be specified for security
    reasons.
    Relay servers obviously require to be hosted on machines with public IP address.
    However additionally an announce endpoint can be specified to host Relay servers
    under the NAT, but with configured PMP or other stuff that allows to forward
    incoming traffic to the private network.
  * Added: build deb-package for Rendezvous and Relay (#533).
  * Added: REST interface for node (#535).
    Flexible REST interface build on top of gRPC services reflection.
  * Added: worker's benchmarks (#530).
    This adds able to measure Worker's performance by executing
    a bunch of benchmarks. Some of the benchmarks are present as statically-coded
    functions that can simply pick-up a value from system (how many bytes of RAM
    or CPU cores count). More complex measurement is implemented as Docker-containers
    which must return a JSON string with the results.  It allows implementing
    some amount of custom logic for each hardware group.
    To keep the Worker's state, the boltdb was added as a simple storage.
  * Added: read memory limit from CGroup (#549).
    Previously we used total amount RAM on the host system as an available memory for scheduling.
    But resources for containers may be limited by a parent CGroup settings.
    This changes how available memory amount is measured.
    The lesser value of `total RAM on host, a limit set for CGroup` is used.
  * Added: collect memory amount for GPU devices (#556)
    This adds able to obtain memory size for GPU devices. Discovered values uses as metrics for
    the `mem-gpu` benchmark.
  * Added: new blockchain API (#569).
  * Added: feat: auto request/response validation (#585)
    This commit activates gRPC request/response auto-validation by injecting an interceptor.
    Those requests/responses that require validation can optionally implement an
    implicit `Validate() error` function that will be called before request starts being processed
    and before response passed to the gRPC internals.
  * Added: show devices with benchmarks (#575).
    This improves device list shown to Worker's owner. The list includes new device
    groups (network, storage). Also, benchmarks results for every device group is shown.
  * Added: ask-plan protobuf entity (#583).
    This introduces new AskPlan entity to be used in worker for placing ask orders on market.
    Intended to use instead of slot.
  * Added: ability to join networks using JoinNetwork command (#599).
  * Added: CLI command to show current balance (#608).
  * Added: show network capabilities into worker's devices (#611).
  * Added: DWH (#548). DWH is a traditional abbreviation for Data Warehouse.
    Typically, it is a component that can receive data from various sources, store it, generate
    additional data slices (built from obtained data), and submit this data to external consumers.
    In SONM environment, the DWH is a node that keeps a copy of the data that has passed through
    the Sidechain and provides fast access mechanisms to this data in a convenient way for the end
    user (client applications and other SONM platform infrastructure components).
  * Added: create order from `bid.yaml` (#607).
    This adds able to read BID orders from the yaml spec and place them on Marketplace.
  * Added: deal matcher.
  * Added: ETH load testing tools.
  * Added: master-worker relationships (#775).
  * Added: ability to save cli config (#790).
  * Added: worker admin (#807).
    This commit allows to specify admin ETH key for a worker to be able
    to have access to worker management tools.
  * Added: autosell bot.
    This bot acts as a separate application and attaches to a specified workers, managing them
    by scanning available resources and trying to sell them using marketplace scanning with
    minor help of machine learning.
  * Added: introduce multi-keystore (#785)
    This adds a keystore implementation which can operate on multiple ethereum keys.
  * Added: add oracle contract (#808).
  * Added: CLI can now purge all ask-plans (#818).
  * Added: manage blacklists from Node (#766).
  * Added: container restart policy (#830).
  * Added: able to parse USD price without space (#834).
  * Added: multi-market token (#825).
  * Added: manually allow to expose container ports (#850).
  * Added: collect disk space info (#880).
  * Changed: update configs and binaries location (#504).
    Now we keep all configs into `etc` directory, while all binaries are now located in
    the `target` directory.
    Now deb package with node creates the `sonm` user account on install, node runs under that
    user.
    Also added OS type and arch into target binary name.
  * Changed: integrate hub into miner (#527).
    Previously hub was used for the following reasons: providing access for workers
    without public IP; resource scheduling between workers; account association for
    large installations
    Currently NPP Allows us to work without public IP's, resource scheduling will be
    done on per machine basis with help of blockchain and account integration will be
    done via smart contract, so there is no reason to leave hub as an entity.
  * Changed: merge worker and hub configs (#577).
  * Changed: drop CLI interactors (#518).
  * Changed: drop cluster (#560)
    The `Cluster` entity was removed from the Hub, now `state` operates with
    the `libkv.Storage` itself.
  * Changed: complete Locator extermination (#568).
  * Changed: update go-ethereum api to v.1.8.2 (#601).
  * Changed: improve order and deal printers (#684).
  * Changed: use dealID to detect corresponding worker when using task API (#686).
    This drops supporting for hub address parameter into task API. Now we're using dealID as
    counterpart identifier to resolve addresses and perform requests.
  * Changed: configurable blockchain endpoints (#697).
  * Changed: extend deal info with tasks and resources (#712).
  * Changed: now smart-contracts are located in this repository.
  * Changed: CLI now always requires --config flag (#744).
  * Changed: make CLI commands more consistent (#786).
    This changes CLI sub-commands semantic to follow the "entity-action" commands style.
    Also, using non-plural words for commands names.

    All components with the same version are guaranteed to work, while otherwise - are not.
  * Added: distributed tracing and audit.
    This quite large addition includes utilities for ease debugging and finding out what the hell
    is going on: audit logs and distributed tracing.
    Now all server components are constructed with audit logs interceptor, which writes a record
    when an RPC request finishes. It includes: time spent, tracing info (new feature), peer
    wallet etc.
  * Added: improved the gateway by allowing several reals under the same virtual service (#363).
