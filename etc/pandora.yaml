    # A gun instance is spawned either at startup or on demand, so its
    # initialization should be as fast as possible.
    # Also note that ammo type prefix should be the same as gun's one, for
    # example this gun has "sonm.marketplace" prefix, while its ammo
    # has "sonm.marketplace.GetOrderInfo".
