  # SecretKey is used to initialize the primary encryption key in a keyring.
  #
  # The primary encryption key is the only key used to encrypt messages and
  # the first key used while attempting to decrypt messages. Providing a
  # value for this primary key will enable message-level encryption and
  # verification, and automatically install the key onto the keyring.
  # The value should be either 16, 24, or 32 bytes to select AES-128,
  # AES-192, or AES-256.
  # Optional. If not configured the encryption/decryption is disabled.
